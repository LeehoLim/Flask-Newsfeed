This repository contains a project that I worked on inspired by Miguel Grinberg’s Python Flask tutorial.

This is a social media newsfeed that allows users to write blog posts for others to see.

User Functions:

-Users can follow or unfollow other users
-Users can explore other users’ blog posts on the “Explore” tab
-Users will see posts of users that they follow on their home tab
-Users can write their own posts
-Users can edit their settings / profiles


Usage:

1) Run the makefile in order to install the requirements: 

“make -f makefile”

2) Check the success_log to see if everything was properly downloaded

"open success_log"

3) Chmod in order to run executable:

“chmod u+x run”

4) Run the run file:

“./run”

5) Hosted on localhost:5000, so go to a web browser of preference and type this in the URL bar

“localhost:5000”

6) Enjoy!
